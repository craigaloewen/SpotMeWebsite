Hello! 
My name is Melissa, I'm a UX design intern at Microsoft, in the Groove team. I am also an Interaction Design MFA student at Ume√• Institute of Design (in Sweden). 

To me, the Hackathon was a golden opportunity to practice not only my every day skills, but most importantly, the ones needed when you start working in a multidisciplinary team, of people you've just met, on a project you've just learned about; which are generally harder to come about and therefore, very precious.  

What I thought was most important for me to contribute as a designer, was to think about how we could empower our user to make the best out of the technology and it's application while still having a pleasurable and intuitive UI experience. So, I worked on the general flow structure and features of the UI and shaped them into simple wireframes that we could use to discuss and define our design directions, but that would just as well help us communicate our idea to the world. 

My biggest takeaway is what I learned from my teammates, how they inspired me to take a peek at what they do and how much I really saw the power of putting several, different brains to work together. I'm proud and grateful to have been part of this team, and now I'll just hope to work out with Spot Me to finally know if my back is really straight when I do deadlifts!
