Hi! My name is Jhony.

I’m a Computer Science major at the University of Waterloo. I am interning as a Software Engineer at Microsoft for summer 2017 in the Edge browser team.

It’s been really fascinating following Craig and his vision for Spot Me. I think it is a really innovative idea for a largely unexplored tool as the Kinect.

I mainly contributed in the backend of the application developing the data types and file management system.

I hope you enjoy using Spot Me and continue your pursuit for the gainzz!
