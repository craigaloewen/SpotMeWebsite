        <title>Craigloewen</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi my name’s Craig!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I’m also a program management intern working at Microsoft for the summer of 2017, on the Windows Console and Windows Subsystem for Linux team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really passionate about fitness, and so I was excited to start Spot Me! I built a prototype for the app in 2016, and it’s AMAZING to see the what our team could do to make the app usable and fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main contributions to the app were &lt;strong&gt;leading development for the code base&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;project management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a PM it was amazing to work with this team, as we were quite cross disciplinary with Melissa being a designer, Kent being a story teller, and Jhony being a developer. I was able to wrangle our different interests and skills to create the app you see before you on this website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer lead Spot Me posed a significant technological challenge. It took a lot of research and finetuning to make the machine learning algorithm accurately predict your form, and lots of code hours to make the UI behave like the proposed design.&lt;/p&gt;
